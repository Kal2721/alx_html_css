This project is about implementing from scratch, without any library, a web page. All HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges will be applied to have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Interactions note:

the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
links hover/active: #FF6565
button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
